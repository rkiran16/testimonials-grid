           I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned were current, if not more so, in the company
            i joined. I honestly feel i got every penny;s worth.

           "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
            the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
            weeks was the best - and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course. I've
            successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer a a VR startup."

           Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

           "Before joining the bootcamp,I've never written a line of code. I needed
            some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming
            step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs
            who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance.
            The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the nexet level
            in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews
            as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
            developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp
            themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from
            their experiences was easy.

            program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present
